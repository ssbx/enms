Enms is a Network Management System aimed to manage and monitor SNMP targets,
monitor network hosts and services. The goal is to unify documentations, 
events and administration tasks under an unified interface.

Enms provide a well documented protocol and API for asynchronous
client access over:
- TCP or SSL over TCP using Asn.1 BER or PER encoded messages.
- (SOON) WebSocket and SSL over Websocket using XML encoded messages.

The project is actualy in his Alpha stage. The first production ready system
(1.0.0) is planned for mid 2013.
