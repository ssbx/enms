Basic Installation
==================

    Used packages are installed with these options:

Erlang/OTP, Version: RB16B02
    ./configure --prefix=/opt/erlang_otp_RB16B02

Rrdtool, Version: 1.4.8
    ./configure --prefix=/opt/rrdtool-1.4.8_SERVER

Nagios-plugins, Version: 1.4.16
    ./configure --prefix=/opt/nagios-plugins-1.4.16


    If you use diferent destinations, you will need to modify by hand the
"ERL" variable in the main Makefile for the erlang bin path, the nagios plugin 
directory and rrdtool executable path in the sys.config file.

    In the sys.config file modify the user who will execute nagios plugins
under the "exec" configuration directives. Default user is "enms".

    Take a look at the configuration file example cfg/monitor.conf.example.
Copy it to cfg/monitor.conf. Every entry is an erlang record wich can be
interpreted using the file lib/monitor/include/monitor.hrl.

    "make start" Will create a local release and start the system. The mean
of Enms is data visualization. You can test the fonctionnalities of it with
the client github.com:ssbx/tkorder
