% Called each time a message responce from the probe fun is received.
% Is it to this module to be sure that a log action is not pending when
% a ?MODULE:dump/2 occur using locks or other.
% This function is called from the channel. The channel can call dump/2
% after. It is to the module to define when a log is pending before
% sending a dump using a gen_server or other lock method.
% Must return {ok, State} when State is a possibly modified State value,
% or {ok, State, Pdu} when Pdu will be sent to registered clients.
% @end

-callback dump(State::any()) -> 
    {ok,        Pdu::tuple(), State::any()}   | 
    {ignore,    State::any()}.
% @doc
% Called by a monitor_probe on a subscribe request by a client. Must
% return a binary form of the data logged or ignore if there is no need.
% For synchronisation, the monitor_probe server will wait for a
% a responce. This function MUST return before some kind of timeout or it will
% indefinitely block the probe server.
% State return is a possibly modified State, Pdu is a tuple message 
% wich will be encoded as is.
