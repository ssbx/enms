// later
- remove #rrd_config.update_regexps, #rrd_config.file_path
- tref() is {A, _Ref} when A is systime + delay, the timestamp of the execution
fun.
- get the time a probe might get informations to initialize timer on the
client at connexion time. If not, the client will only be initialized with
the first reception of a probe message (deducing the time using the probe
specific properties step and timeout).
- only send messages to ifs_mpd when "clients > 0".

// later
- probe dependencies
- composed service
