- delayed sync included in supercast, require that every channel event is
recognized by supercast.
- lock on subscribe rationalize (channel,client,loggers) and document. Actualy
a channel will block wile it is synchronizing a client. It is possible to not
block, but it vastly increase code complexity for supercast_logger,
ssl/tcp_client and supercast_channel modules.

# in the future
- protobuff support
- replace with rabbitmq?
- Behaviour in a distributed environment with multiple supercast servers
running?
