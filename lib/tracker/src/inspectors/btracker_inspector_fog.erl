% This inspector is used to prevent a shaded device to send alerts.
% Note that a shaded device is configurable via the "fog" module.
% If a module status change fog will check the availability of parent
% devices. If one of them is down, the module keep track of the current
% status and set it to 'SHADED'. Once the parents are up, the status is
% set to the previous value.
