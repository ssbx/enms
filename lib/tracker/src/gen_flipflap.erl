% A module implementing this behaviour can be set used as flipflap detection
% module.
% <p>It is used from a "tracker_probe" server giving his #probe_server_state{} 
% as argument. The return include a possibly modified #probe_server_state{}.
% </p>
% <p>
%   A gen_flipflap module can keep his state in the 
%   <em>#probe_server_state.flipflap_state</em> record entry.
% <br></br><b>Be aware that
%   puting a large amount of data here can have effect on the target_probe 
%   server.</b>
