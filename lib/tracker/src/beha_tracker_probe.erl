% A module implementing this behaviour can be used as a probe module.
% <p>
% It used from a tracker_probe module and executed every 
% (#probe.step seconds + process_time).
% </p>
% <h1>Probe type</h1>
% <p>
% Probes are of 3 general types. One probe can be any or all of them:
%   - "set", set properties of the target depending of a return,
%   - "get", retreive some value or generate it (reply latency),
%   - "status", move the status of a probe,
% </p>
% <h1>Special probes</h1>
% <p>
% Two spectial probes:
%   - "nagios", nagios compatible plugins wich is of type "status" and "get",
%   - "snmp", wich can be of any type "set", "get" and "status".
% </p>

% The return from this function will trigger another probe execution after a
% delay defined by the #probe.step entry.
% <em>exec</em> will then be called (#probe.step + (time for exec to return))
% time.

exec(_) -> {ok, 1}.

% @doc
% Called by the tracker_master_channel for presentation of the module to the

% parameters explanations.
