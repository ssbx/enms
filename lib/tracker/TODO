- get the time a probe might get informations to initialize timer on the
client at connexion time. If not, the client will only be initialized with
the first reception of a probe message (deducing the time using the probe
specific properties step and timeout).
- only send messages to ifs_mpd when "clients > 0".
- do not send a full #probe_server_state{} to loggers, inspectors and probe.
Move the save state logic to the tracker_probe.erl.
