- supercast               HIGH          100% Module events and client
                                                communication/auth

SNMP utility and monitoring + Live list of snmp targets
- probe nagios compatible HIGH          100%
Add the possibility to not interpret perf values. It should not be encouraged
since these values are not standardized.
- probe logging text      HIGH          100%
- probe logging rrd       HIGH          100%
Generate data for RRD or flat file for example. These files must be
understood by the client.
- create read only client               100%
Using Qt
---------> RELEASE 0.9

- rrd_database second     HIGH          100%
To handle in one probe a large number of DS rrd_logger must break the
rrds in small parts.
- logger_events 1         HIGH          100%
Target events of interest. Will be represented as time plots on the
client. Include work on future traps_mod and syslog_mod.
- update client (logger_events)         70%
Work on UI designs.
- save target state       HIGH          0%
- startup script          HIGH          70%
--------> RELEASE B1.0

- mail alerts             HIGH          0%
With treaded reply to receivers on acknowlegement. Linked to acknownledgement
system.
- parent association      HIGH          0%
With triggered update of parents on a failure.
- depend association      HIGH          0%
Configurable events. Add probe dependency (different from probe parent). Will
create an event for the dependent probes. Event correlation will be easier.
- logger_events 2         HIGH          0%
Include concept of documented Acknoledgement.
- probe_snmp_v3           HIGH          0%
- snmp traps handling     HIGH          0%
With logger_events
- inspector_rrd_warn      HIGH          0%
Alerts on rrdfetch and probe status events.
Alert on value returned by rrdfetch. Compare with an AVERAGE expected
value. Apply an algorithm. Send an alert if needed.
Will need to use a gen_event somewhere in tlogger_rrd to put a fun which will 
wait for the current probe_return to be writed to the file.rrd and then query
the rrd. A delayed inspector in some way because inspectors are launch before
loggers.
- read/write client with permissions.   HIGH    0%
need definition of API. The system should be usable without writing the
configuration file. Targets should be added deleted in live.

---------> RELEASE 1
