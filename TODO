The development flow should follow this order:

#MODULE/OTHER           #PRIORITY   #COMPLETED
- supercast               HIGH          100% Module events and client
                                                communication/auth
- tracker                 HIGH          100%
Live list of targets, associate tags to traps/inform they produce and own the
mermisions associated. 
- probe_snmp_v2           HIGH          100%
SNMP utility and monitoring + Live list of snmp targets
- probe nagios compatible HIGH          100%
- probe logging text      HIGH          100%
- probe logging rrd       HIGH          100%%
Generate data for RRD or flat file for example. These files must be
understood by the client.
- create read only client               80%
Using Qt
---------> RELEASE 0.9,


- probe_snmp_v3           HIGH          0%
- inspector_parent        HIGH          0%
Parent/child probe association.
- inspector_warn          HIGH          0%
Create alerts with events patterns or events values. See Mmonit sintax
language. Use an allready existing job scheduler?
- inspector_rrd_warn      HIGH          0%
Alerts on rrdfetch and probe status events.
Alert on value returned by rrdfetch. Compare with an AVERAGE expected
value. Apply an algorithm. Send an alert if needed.
Will need to use a gen_event somewhere in tlogger_rrd to put a fun which will 
wait for the current probe_return to be writed to the file.rrd and then query
the rrd. A delayed inspector in some way.
- inspector_inertie       HIGH          0%
False positive detection.
- logger_events           HIGH          0%
Target events of interest. Will be represented as time plots on the
client.
- config file               HIGH        0%
Human readable configuration file.yaml. Generate erlang terms with m4 or awk or
sh or perl or both. Use of templates.
---------> RELEASE 1.0,


- nagios_conf                            0%
Extract nagios config for his config files. (Makefile)
(inspectors)
- wmaps                   HIGH        0%
Create, save and generate (what format?) maps (manual links between nodes).
The final map should look like the cacti/weathermap module + visual alerts.
(http://graphite.wikidot.com/whisper viewable in web browsers???)
---------> RELEASE 2.0,


- read/write client with permissions.   MEDIUM  0%
need definition of API. The system should be usable without writing the
configuration file. Targets should be added deleted in live.
- telnet_client                         MEDIUM  0%
---------> RELEASE 3.0,

TODO UB2:
- mod_shell,
- mod_switching,
- mod_snmp_disco,
- command line,
- wmap

TODO performance:
btracker_probe_nagios:eval_nagios_output/1 might use re:run instead 
of string:token
