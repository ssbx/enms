% Rrdtool configuration template for a smoke ping like latency check.

% INTERVAL: must be less than the update received to have a new graph
% every update. Else, rrdtool will consolidate until INTERVAL is reached.
% EARTBEAT must be less than the interval if we want rrd to put "null"
% value if ONE interval fail.
% MIN is the expected minimum value. Other values lesser than it are ignored
% MAX is the expected maximum value. Other values greater than it are ignored
% CF is the consolidation function if more than one update occure withing 
%   INTERVAL time.
