Enms is a Network Management System aimed to manage and monitor SNMP targets,
monitor network hosts and services, provide a consistent documentation system
and provide tools to help network professionals to have a wide perspective of
the networks they manage.

Enms provide a well documented protocol and API for asynchronous
client access over:
- TCP or SSL over TCP using Asn.1 BER or PER encoded messages.
- (SOON) WebSocket and SSL over Websocket using XML encoded messages.

Enms is written in Erlang/OTP. The native support for distributed programming
and fault-tolerence will be used in the future to build scalable distributed
infrastructure.

The project is actualy in his Alpha stage. The first production ready system
(1.0.0) is planned for mid 2013.


== BUILD ==

Enms is developed using 'Erlang R15B02 (erts-5.9.2)' but should work with any
Erlang R15+ version. 

$ make


== DOC ==

(Partial) Documentation is generated using the Erlang 'edoc' tool. It is 
accessible in the 'doc' directory in each modules after issuing the following
command:

$ make doc


== RUNNING SERVER ==

Actualy, Enms only have a SNMP module wich have incomplete and 
indocumented API.
Its actual primary function is to help develop the 'ifs' module, sending traps
events.
You can start the ifs and enmp module using:

$ make start

Note that a 'sudo erl' is used to allow the snmp module to listen to the root 
port 162. You can change this by modifying the 'snmp' part of the 'sys.config'
file, and the Makefile.
Note that this snmp configuration refere to the Erlang/OTP snmp module. Refere
to the concerned documentation to modify these values.


== RUNNING CLI CLIENT == 

You can use the command line client "clifs" using the following commande in
another shell:

$ make clifs


== BUGS ==

This is an Alpha work. It is not meant to be used in a production environment
for now.
